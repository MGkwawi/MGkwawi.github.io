        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add oil into a pot and heat over medium high heat.

</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Add onion and sauté for a few minutes or until the onion becomes translucent and edges start getting slightly burnt.
</p>
<p>Add potatoes and carrots into the pot and stir for a couple of minutes or until the surface of the vegetables starts getting cooked.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Add potatoes and carrots into the pot and stir for a couple of minutes or until the surface of the vegetables starts getting cooked.


</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>You may pre-make the curry and serve it later. The curry can be kept for few days in the fridge, 1 month in the freezer.

</p>
<p>When the curry cools down, the sauce thickens. The consistency of the sauce should be like béchamel sauce. Check the consistency of the sauce after re-heating and if too thick, adjust with water.

</p>
<p>To defrost your curry, see the post for two different methods.

</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>I did not use it but you can add Fukujinzuke (Condiment for Japanese Curry) if you have it.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius). If necessary, grease all 12 cups of your muffin tin with butter or non-stick cooking spray (my pan is non-stick and didn’t require any grease).</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>In a large bowl, beat the oil and maple syrup or honey together with a whisk. Add the eggs, and beat well. Add the pumpkin purée, milk, pumpkin spice blend, baking soda, vanilla extract and salt.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Add the flour and oats to the bowl and mix with a large spoon, just until combined (a few lumps are ok). If you’d like to add any additional mix-ins***, like nuts, chocolate or dried fruit, fold them in now.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups. Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with about a tablespoon of oats, followed by a light sprinkle of raw sugar and/or pumpkin spice blend if you’d like. Bake muffins for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack to cool. These muffins are delicate until they cool down. You might need to run a butter knife along the outer edge of the muffins to loosen them from the pan.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong>These muffins taste even better after they have rested for a couple of hours! They’ll keep at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. They keep well in the freezer in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months (just defrost individual muffins as needed).</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Combine the yeast, warm water, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer, and let sit for 10 minutes until foamy. This indicates the yeast is alive and working. Add the flour and salt. Mix with the dough hook by hand for a few seconds to roughly combine, then fit the hook and bowl on the mixer and knead on medium low for 5 minutes. The dough should feel soft and smooth, not sticky to the touch.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Cover the dough and let rise for 30 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, and lightly grease a baking sheet with vegetable oil. You could use parchment paper or a silicone mat.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Place the dough onto a lightly oiled countertop. Divide the dough into 8 pieces (just cut it with a knife).</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Whisk to combine the warm water and baking soda and cook in the microwave for 1 minute. FYI it’s not going to dissolve completely, and that’s okay.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Roll each of the eight pieces into a long rope, and shape each one into a pretzel (see the step-by-step photos on the blog post to see how to do this). Dip each pretzel into the soda wash and place onto the greased baking sheet. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt, then let them rest for 10 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong>Bake for 9 to 10 minutes until the pretzels are golden brown. Brush the pretzels with the melted butter while they are hot out of the oven. Enjoy while they are hot, and keep in mind these don’t taste as amazing the next day. Enjoy!</p>
